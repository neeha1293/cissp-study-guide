# CISSP Study Guide

How to pass the CISSP in only a month? 

Background about me: 
I have 5 years of experience in InfoSec, mostly focussed on product security. I prepared for CISSP in April 2024 and passed my exam on April 29, 2024 at just 100 questions. You will need only 4 kinds of material to pass your exam under a month:
- a textbook
- a mobile-based quiz app
- video content
- mindset and exam strategy


## Study Resources

### Textbook

CISSP Official Study Guide 9th edition. 

This will give you the technical knowledge needed in all the domains. However, the quiz questions in this book are only to test your textbook knowledge. The actual questions in the exam will be vastly different from the quiz questions in ANY textbook or practice test. 

### Subscription apps

Pocket Prep. 

The app will be useful for you to:
- reinforce your learning after each chapter (take the short 10 question quiz whenever you have time)
- identify weak domains (you can set the app to test you only on your chosen domains)
- understand why a certain answer is right/wrong (the app provides explanations to each answer which is a must-have feature)

Once again, the questions on this app are only to drill down your technical knowledge, but the questions on the exam will be vastly different from any mock quiz. 

### Video Material on Youtube

CISSP Exam Cram Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD&si=-o5CxLWYDNERjk8C
CISSP Exam Cram Full Course: https://youtu.be/_nyZhYnCNLA?si=A-KNw6OSTDZO4B_q

Watch these after you're done reading all the chapters in the textbook. These videos help your brain to summarize the vast amount of information you just read across all the domains, otherwise it's easy to forget and confuse it all. These videos digest and segregate info across the domains into buckets for your brain to remember. For example, the playlists contain videos like "CISSP Exam Cram-Laws and Regulations", "Cryptography Drill Down", "Processes, Frameworks and Models". 

### CISSP Mindset and Exam Strategy Resources

These videos are like the seal to the package. They contain some very crucial tips on how to select the right answer in your main exam. Without the right mindset, no amount of tech knowledge may help you. It may infact confuse and fail you. These videos also help you understand what kind of questions to expect in the exam. They will not be straightforward, and no amount of mock quizzes will help in that.
