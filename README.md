How to pass the CISSP in only a month? 

Background about me: 
I have 5 years of experience in InfoSec, mostly focussed on product security. I prepared for CISSP in April 2024 and passed my exam on April 29, 2024 at just 100 questions. You will need only 4 kinds of material to pass your exam under a month:
- a textbook
- a mobile-based quiz app
- video content
- exam mindset and strategy.


## Study Resources

### Textbook

CISSP Official Study Guide 9th edition. 

This will give you the technical knowledge needed in all the domains. However, the quiz questions in this book are only to test your textbook knowledge. The actual questions in the exam will be vastly different from the quiz questions in ANY textbook or practice test. 

### Subscription apps

Pocket Prep. 

The app will be useful for you to:
- reinforce your learning after each chapter (take the short 10 question quiz whenever you have time)
- identify weak domains (you can set the app to test you only on your chosen domains)
- understand why a certain answer is right/wrong (the app provides explanations to each answer which is a must-have feature)

Once again, the questions on this app are only to drill down your technical knowledge, but the questions on the exam will be vastly different from any mock quiz.
